What is Ava?
----------------

Ava is a digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Ava uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Ava Core is built with Dash Core open
source software which enables the use of this currency.
